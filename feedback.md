In practical 4 mystery_code.py:
    Professor said that my answer is mostly correct, but didn't mention it was numbers between 1 and 6.
    I answered without pointing out the code is randomly choosing from 1-6, just said it is like a dice.
    It is not clear enough and may lead misunderstanding, so I chaneg it to point out it is from 1-6.
